    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 development release #31 ("Atlanta")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce the
July 2010 development release of Rakudo Perl #31 "Atlanta".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine
(see <http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the July 2010 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release named
after a Perl Mongers group. The July 2010 release is code named "Atlanta"
in recognition of Atlanta.pm and their Perl 5 Phalanx project [1], which
they selected for its benefits to Perl 6.

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* [XXX update]
* 
* 
* [XXX update]Rakudo now passes 33,378 spectests. We estimate that there are about
  39,900 tests in the test suite, so Rakudo passes about 83% of all tests.

For a more detailed list of changes see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on parrot, the
Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:
Patrick R. Michaud, Moritz Lenz, Jonathan Worthington, Solomon Foster,
Patrick Abi Salloum, Carl Mäsak, Martin Berends, Will "Coke" Coleda,
Vyacheslav Matjukhin, snarkyboojum, chromatic, Tyler Curtis, Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ,
Bruce Gray, Stephen Weeks, Andrew Whitworth

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>, ask on
the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#32) is scheduled for August 19, 2010.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2010 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
