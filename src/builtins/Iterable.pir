Iterable - Perl 6 Iterable Role

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Iterable is the role for objects that can produce
iterators and flatten in list contexts.

XXX:  This file implements Iterable as a class
for the time being, because Pm was tired of struggling
with making it into a role.  Eventually it should
be made into a role, and the classes that are defined
as "is Iterable" should be come "does Iterable".
